== Further information on the usage of caller.ino ==

The script is designed to place a call with a push of a button. Using the internal DECT call function one could use this as e.g. a doorbell.

One can use an opto-coupler in order to use it with existing infrastrucutre (e.g. an existing doorbell), otherwise a regular switch can be used (see code). Schematics might be added in the future. If you need further guidance, provide your own example or find a bug, please open an issue here on Github.
