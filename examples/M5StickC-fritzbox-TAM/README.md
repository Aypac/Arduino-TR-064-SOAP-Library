# Further information on the usage of M5StickC-fritzbox-TAM.ino

Yes, out of the box it just runs on a M5StickC. Yes, you can adopt it easily but you need to integrate a display/LED and button. Furthermore it is based on a ESP32-PICO.
The idea behind this was the challenge for elderly people to recognize easily the status of the TAM. However the fritz!fon buttons are small and the menu too complex. Therefore some Gigasets E290HX were used, because the HD feature is pretty good for those people, the buttons are big and it has an loudness amplifier. But there is no TAM station like the E290A, this would be ideal.
