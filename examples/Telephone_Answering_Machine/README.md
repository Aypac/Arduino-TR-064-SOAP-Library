# Further information on the usage of Telephone_Answering_Machine.ino

Was developed on a M5StickC, might not work out of the box on other platforms.
The idea behind this was the challenge for elderly people to recognize easily the status of the Telephone Answering Machine (TAM). However the FRITZ!fon buttons are small and the menu too complex. Therefore some Gigasets E290HX were used, because the HD feature is pretty good for those people, the buttons are big and it has an loudness amplifier. But there is no TAM station like the E290A, this would be ideal.
