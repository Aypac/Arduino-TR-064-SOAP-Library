# Arduino-TR-064-SOAP-Library [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Aypac/Arduino-TR-064-SOAP-Library.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Aypac/Arduino-TR-064-SOAP-Library)
Arduino library to facilitate the use of the TR-064 protocol ([definition](https://www.broadband-forum.org/technical/download/TR-064.pdf) and [description](https://avm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Global/Service/Schnittstellen/AVM_TR-064_first_steps.pdf)), most commonly used by Fritz!Box.

This library has been developed on an ESP8266 and tested on an ESP32.

To get started, I recommend to check out the [examples folder](https://github.com/Aypac/Arduino-TR-064-SOAP-Library/tree/master/examples), the [Wiki](https://github.com/Aypac/Arduino-TR-064-SOAP-Library/wiki) and the [instructable](http://www.instructables.com/id/Who-Is-Home-Indicator-aka-Weasley-Clock-Based-on-T/).

If you still have question please don't hesistate to [open an issue here on Github](https://github.com/Aypac/Arduino-TR-064-SOAP-Library/issues/new). If you made something cool with this library please provide it as an example. Please create a pull request (or, if you don't know how, [an issue](https://github.com/Aypac/Arduino-TR-064-SOAP-Library/issues/new)) to do that.

## Installation and usage
Simply go to `Tools → Manage Libraries...` in the Arduino IDE and search for `TR-064`. Press install. The examples can then also be found in the IDE under `Examples → TR-064 SOAP Library`.

Don't forget that you also need to [add the board you are using to the IDE](https://learn.adafruit.com/add-boards-arduino-v164/setup);

## Press
 
 - The German magazine C'T, published [an article on how to create a doorbell using the DECT phones and an ESP8266 (in German)](https://www.heise.de/select/ct/2018/17/1534215254552977).
 - A similar article was also featured in Reichelt magazine (an electronics vendor) in [English](https://www.reichelt.com/magazin/en/build-smart-doorbell-arduino), [German](https://www.reichelt.de/magazin/how-to/smarte-tuerklingel) and [Dutch](https://www.reichelt.com/magazin/nl/zelf-een-slimme-deurbel-maken).
 

# TODO

Help is very welcome! For example:
 - Please let me know if you came up with a cool use-case (I'd love to add more examples, see also list at the end of this file)
 - Let me know if you tested it on hardware not listed here (i.e. other microcontroller and other routers)
 - If you have any suggestions on how to improve the library code itself (I'm not particularily good with C++). I moved the TODO's mostly into the [issue section on Github](https://github.com/Aypac/Arduino-TR-064-SOAP-Library/issues), or check out the list below.
 - Contributions to the [Wiki](https://github.com/Aypac/Arduino-TR-064-SOAP-Library/wiki) are also very welcome!

Some of the old issues are:

### Library

* Add yield()'s (where sensible)
* Do some (better) error-handeling
  * Return proper errors
* Reduce occasional crashes (should be fixed, but please report if still encountered)
* Should some of the calls of the examples be included into the library?

### Examples

* Add yield()'s (where sensible)
* Try to find a way to externalize the settings (WIFI etc)
* Add a few more nice examples
  * turning on/off (guest) wifi
  * read out connection speed
  * alternate WPS button
  * emergency dial-up to relatives or emergency services
  * recognize when devices (like washing machines) are done (along the lines of [this](https://github.com/dl9sec/ArduinoSIP/tree/master/examples/LaundryNotifier)
  * Start devices through e.g. telegram messages (e.g. coffee machine, washing machine, ...)
* WhoIsHomeIndicator
  * Add nice GUI/Website to configure/manage the users/LEDs/MACs/known devices
  * Known Bug: After a few hours the known devices "freeze", needs restart (might be fixed, but please report if still encountered)
* Extend doorbell example to also send telegram messages :)
